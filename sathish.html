<h2>LIFESTORY</h2>
<br></br>
<h3><middle>The name is sathish vemala who believes in hardwork. I like to inspire people with my motivational words.  
    I struggled a lot right from my childhood to achieve my goals.I went through lot of problems and learned 
    so many lessons. The only thing I strongly believe is stay humble, work hard maintain consistency one day
    success will be yours. I do not want to take help from others because I like to do the things in my own way. 
    I dont trust any one easily but once I trust a person I will never leave them till my last breath. I prefer to 
    stay alone most of the time beacuse we can understand ourself well when we are alone. No body helps me right 
    from my childhood days I was here now with the help of my hardwork, dedication and commitment.</middle></h3>
<br></br>
<h2>LIFE EXPERIENCE</h2>
<br></br>
<h3><middle>Never trust people easily because once you trust a person blindly you will definitely regret one day.
    Never do boasting infront of people because they think that you are showing off. Never depend on others because
    at the end of the day you are alone. Never expect anything from anyone because expectations always hurts.
    Never blame others for your mistakes always try to learn from your mistakes. Do not feel bad when you are fail
    because every failure is stepping stone for success . Always try to motivate yourself and dedicate your level 
    best to achieve your goals.</middle>
    <br></br>
